# TypingLogger

TypingLogger is a Python-based keylogger application that records keyboard activity. It is packaged as a standalone executable using PyInstaller for easy deployment.

## Features

- Logs all keystrokes to a file
- Runs silently in the background (no console window)
- Easy to build into a single executable
- Customizable build options

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or compatible version
- [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/) (`pip install pyinstaller`)

### Building the Executable

To build the keylogger executable, run:

```sh
python build_keylogger.py
```

This will generate a standalone executable in the `build/TypingLogger_<date>/` directory.

#### Build Options

You can customize the build by editing the following variables in [`build_keylogger.py`](build_keylogger.py):

- `APP_NAME`: Name of the application
- `SCRIPT_FILE`: Entry point script (default: `word_keylogger.py`)
- `ICON_FILE`: Path to a custom icon (optional)
- `ADD_DATA`: List of additional files/folders to include
- `ONE_FILE`: Build as a single file (`True`) or directory (`False`)
- `CONSOLE`: Show console window (`True`) or run silently (`False`)

### Running the Keylogger

After building, run the generated executable. The keylogger will start logging keystrokes as defined in [`word_keylogger.py`](word_keylogger.py).
